# OSI-STM32F407-DB_T

# One side implementation of the Leraso rover drive/steering chain with a STM32F407 Disco Board

##  the STM32F441 Disco baord is the starting point for the later implementation of a drive unit

- [ ] the description of the behavior/function/settings are in the documentation folder
- [ ] 
- [ ] first implementation -> one motor with a half bridge driver (1 half of the IL9110 board) and 2 timer use as PWM for drive and steering
- [ ] 
- [ ] second implementation -> setup CAN controller on the STM32 side with loop back or external device
- [ ] 
- [ ] third implementation -> establish connection with BBB and Disco baord over CAN
- [ ] 
- [ ] fourth implementation -> combine all previous implementation to a BlackPill-CAN module
